Welcome to the DSA-Grind repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting and storing solutions and algorithms for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem is stored in its own directory with the following structure:

```plaintext
DSA-Grind/
│
├── Problem-1/
│   ├── problem_link.txt       # Contains the link to the problem statement
│   ├── solution.cpp           # Contains the solution code for the problem
│   └── algorithm.txt          # Contains the algorithm or approach used to solve the problem
│
├── Problem-2/
│   ├── problem_link.txt
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   └── algorithm.txt
│
└── README.md                  # Overview of the repository
```

# 🚀 How to Use

1.**Navigate to a Problem Directory**:
   - Each problem is stored in its own directory named `Problem-x`, where `x` is the problem number.

2.**Problem Link**:
   - The `problem_link.txt` file contains the URL to the problem statement.

3.**Solution**:
   - The `solution.cpp` file contains the C++ solution code for the problem.

4.**Algorithm**:
   - The `algorithm.txt` file provides a detailed description of the approach or algorithm used to solve the problem.

## 💡 Example

Here is an example structure for a problem directory:

### Problem-1

**problem_link.txt**:

https://example.com/problem-1


// Example solution code
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

## Usage/Examples

## 💡 Example

Here is an example structure for a problem directory:

### Problem-1

**problem_link.txt**:



**solution.cpp**:
```cpp
// Example solution code
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    void printHelloWorld() {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    sol.printHelloWorld();
    return 0;
}
```


## Algorithm.txt

    1. Read the input.
    2. Initialize the necessary variables.
    3. Implement the algorithm step by step:
    - Step 1: Create a Solution class.
    - Step 2: Define a method to print "Hello, World!".
    - Step 3: In the main function, create an instance of the Solution class.
    - Step 4: Call the method to print "Hello, World!".
    4. Return or output the result.
